### Day 1: 25 February 2022, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally, the first day of the 100DaysOfCode. I'm pretty excited to push myself to stay consistent (which is something I'm struggling with at the moment), and I want to use this challenge to really progress my knowledge of iOS Development while building some interesting apps. I have been using Swift for a while now, but I feel like I should really focus on SwiftUI.  
Today I finished Part 1 of Apple's [Introducing SwiftUI Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views). I'm actually impressed with how simple it was to create a fairly good-looking UI and it got me super curious for the next few parts of the course.  
Apart from the tutorial tasks, I managed to add a MapMarker to the map view - this was a lot more complex than I was expecting as the process to do it is not super straighforward. 
I also learned about a few useful Xcode features like the SwiftUI inspector and the Views/Modifiers library.   

**Key Takeaways**: 

- [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) was super useful to create the .gitignore file for the project I worked on today.
- Learned about the SwiftUI inspector in Xcode 
- The Views and Modifiers library in Xcode will definitely come in handy.
- First time using MapKit
- We can use the @State attribute to establish a source of truth for data in our app that we can modify from more than one view.
