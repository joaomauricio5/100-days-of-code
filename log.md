### Day 1: 25 February 2022, Friday
### **SwiftUI - Creating and combining views**

**Today's Progress**: Finally, the first day of the 100DaysOfCode. I'm pretty excited to push myself to stay consistent (which is something I'm struggling with at the moment), and I want to use this challenge to really progress my knowledge of iOS Development while building some interesting apps. I have been using Swift for a while now, but I feel like I should really focus on SwiftUI.  
Today I finished Part 1 of Apple's [Introducing SwiftUI Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views). I'm actually impressed with how simple it was to create a fairly good-looking UI and it got me super curious for the next few parts of the course.  
Apart from the tutorial tasks, I managed to add a MapMarker to the map view - this was a lot more complex than I was expecting as the process to do it is not super straighforward. 
I also learned about a few useful Xcode features like the SwiftUI inspector and the Views/Modifiers library.   

**Key Takeaways**: 

- [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) was super useful to create the .gitignore file for the project I worked on today.
- Managed to get some more practice with Git and Github.
- Learned about the SwiftUI inspector in Xcode 
- The Views and Modifiers library in Xcode will definitely come in handy.
- First time using MapKit
- We can use the @State attribute to establish a source of truth for data in our app that we can modify from more than one view.

### Day 2: 26 February 2022, Saturday
### **Intro to JSON files in Swift + Enums**

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the 2nd part of Apple's [Introducing SwiftUI Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation) (Building Lists and Navigation) and made some progress, but ultimately got stuck for a while, specifically in the part where we need to extract data from a JSON file and assign it to an object. Although we have access to the code that does exactly that, I'm not yet 100% understanding it, and I have the feeling that understanding this is going to be really useful. However, today I'm pretty tired from work (arrived home at 9PM) so I put JSON on hold until tomorrow and I worked on something a little bit simpler.  
I finished the Enums section of Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer), which allowed me code a little bit with iterating over enums, extracting and assigning rawValues, associated values, as well as defining/using methods and computed properties within enums.

**Key Takeaways**: 

- JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays.
- Planned in some questions to explore tomorrow around extracting data from JSON files specifically with Swift
- Got some more practice with computed properties, which I wasn't 100% comfortable with
- Enumerations (or enums) are used to define a new custom type with a list of possible cases. When creating an instance of an enumeration, its value must be one of the cases.

### Day 3: 27 February 2022, Sunday
### **More Enums + Prep for JSON decoding**

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed Codecademy's Enums project for Swift. Not really complex but forced me to practice and actually utilise what I learnt yesterday about Enums in a more "real-world" scenario. 
Additionally, I went back to the part where I got stuck in yesterday's [SwiftUI - Building Lists and Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation) (Decoding JSON files) and identified what I need to learn to overcome this part: Tomorrow I will go through Codecademy's JSON Encoding and Decoding article in Swift, [Swift's Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html) (specifically do-catch statements and the *try* keyword), as well as studying/practicing generics and guard statements. Realistically, these are the concepts I don't fully understand from going through Apple's SwiftUI tutorial source code, so I'm expecting that splitting it into these many parts will help me progress.

**Key Takeaways**:  
  
Checklist for tomorrow to understand the JSON file decoding part of [SwiftUI - Building Lists and Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation):
- Codecademy - JSON Encoding and Decoding in Swift
- Generics
- Guard statements
- Error handling in Swift (do-catch statements and *try* keyword)

### Day 4: 28 February 2022, Monday
### **JSON Decoding/Encoding in Swift + Optionals**

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through Codecademy's article about JSON Decoding and Encoding in Swift and realised that, actually, the process itself is fairly simple, as long as we are working with structures that only have properties that conform to Encodable/Decodable/Codable. This made me acknowledge that what I wasn't really understanding in the JSON file decoding part of [SwiftUI - Building Lists and Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation) was actually not the JSON handling itself, but other intermediate Swift concepts that I never used myself: Optionals, Generics, do-catch statements, the *try* keyword and throwing functions.   
With this in mind, I completed the Codecademy module about Swift Optionals, which forced me to utilise the ***!*** operator to force unwrap optionals, optional binding with the *if let* statement, *guard* statements, and the *?? - nil-coalescing* operator. I finished the day of by completing a small Codecademy project using what I learnt about Optionals (link is below)

**Key Takeaways**:  
  
- JavaScript Object Notation, abbreviated as JSON, is a format for storing data. When online APIs send data to an application, they usually use JSON as the format for the data. Competing formats to JSON include XML and YAML.
- JSON objects are very similar to Swift dictionaries. Just like a dictionary, a JSON object contains some number of key-value pairs.
- *Codable* protocol combines the *Encodable* and *Decodable* protocols
- Swift's Foundation framework includes JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder
- Optionals represent variables that might be absent
- Force unwrapping - ! Only use the ! operator if you are absolutely sure that the value isn’t nil. Otherwise, the program will crash.
- Safely unwrap optionals by using an if let statement to bind the optional to a new variable.
- The nil-coalescing operator ?? unwraps an optional value and provides a default if the optional is nil.
- A guard block is another way to write a conditional in Swift. All guard statements must have an else block that exits the current scope if the boolean expression is false. If the guard statement is true, the code below continues executing.

### Day 5: 1 March 2022, Tuesday
### **Error Handling in Swift + Protocols/Generics**

**Today's Progress**: Today I started by learning Error Handling with Swift. I explored what throwing functions are and how they can be useful in order to specify the kinds of errors our programs might come across. To call throwing functions I also learned about the *try* keyword, its different variations (*try*, *try?* and *try!*), and the do-catch statement. Lastly, I completed a module from Codecademy's [Learn Intermediate Swift Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-swift) regarding Protocols and Generics, which culminated in a small project exploring those concepts (link [here](https://app.codingrooms.com/w/ILhbd3gbqTAe)).  
With this new knowledge, I now feel ready to continue the [SwiftUI - Building Lists and Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation) Tutorial in such a way that I actually understand what is going on. I will continue that project tomorrow!

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Throwing functions are those that will flag up errors if problems happen, and Swift requires you to handle those errors in your code.
- You need to use the try keyword to call a throwing function.
- Using try! is like force unwrapping an optional, and should be used only when you are sure that no errors will be thrown. Use try! whenever you want to crash when a error is thrown
- If you’d like to call a throwing function safely but don’t need to handle the errors independently, you can use try?. Using try? means that if the call fails, it simply becomes nil. Using try? converts the throwing function’s return type into an optional.
- You use a do-catch statement to handle errors by running a block of code. If an error is thrown by the code in the do clause, it’s matched against the catch clauses to determine which one of them can handle the error.
- A protocol is a set of standards that classes, structs, or enums can choose to implement in their own ways. These standards come in the form of properties and functions.
- The definitions of protocols are very similar to classes and structs. However, in the case of protocols, the definition does not implement the properties and functions. Instead, the class or struct that adopts the protocol handles the implementation of the properties and methods.
- A protocol can inherit from another protocol, like a class can inherit from another class.
- In an extension for a protocol, you can provide default implementations of its requirements.
- Generics allow us to create functions that make few assumptions about the underlying data types of its arguments and can be used with multiple data types.
- Opaque types allow us to hide the specific data type that is being returned from the caller. The caller doesn’t need to know the exact type being returned in this case, only that the function should return something that conforms to a certain protocol.

### Day 6: 2 March 2022, Wednesday
### **Finally overcoming the JSON Tutorial!**

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally completed the 2nd part of Apple's [SwiftUI Essentials Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation). Really good to look back on [Day 2](#day2) of this challenge and remind myself that I didn't understand 80% of this part of the tutorial just 4 days ago! Splitting these problems into many different tasks or concepts to learn really has been benefitial in my progress. Also, the do-catch statement finally came in handy while I was debugging my JSON decoding implementation today. It really allowed me to find the specific part of my code that needed to be changed.  Will definitely try and use it more in the future.  
Also had the chance to learn more about Preview modifiers such as *previewLayout*, *previewDevice* and *previewDisplayName*, as well as Lists and navigation in SwiftUI Apps (using NavigationView and NavigationLink).


**Key Takeaways**:  
- In SwiftUI, you can use a Group to return multiple previews from a preview provider.
- previewLayout modifier for Previews
- previewDevice modifier can include more devices in the preview (useful to see how the app reacts to different window sizes)
- Use the previewDisplayName(_:) modifier to add the device names as labels for the previews.
- List is a container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column, optionally providing the ability to select one or more members.
- Lists work with identifiable data. You can make your data identifiable in one of two ways: by passing along with your data a key path to a property that uniquely identifies each element, or by making your data type conform to the Identifiable protocol.
- You add navigation capabilities to a list by embedding it in a NavigationView, and then nesting each row in a NavigationLink to set up a transtition to a destination view.

### Day 7: 3 March 2022, Thursday
### **Closures in Swift**

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally completed Codecademy's Course in [Intermediate Swift](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-swift) by finishing the Closures module. I should say this course stretched my brain a little bit, but it's really great to be continuously learning more and more concepts (which I can definitely apply to other programming languages apart from Swift). I have seen closures being used in some CodeWars solutions but never took the time to fully understand them. I can now see how useful they can be, specifically when paired up with Swift higher-order methods like reduce, map, filter , etc etc.


**Key Takeaways**:  
- Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality. Just like functions, closures take in arguments, execute instructions, and return a value or Void.
- Closures may be referred to as blocks or lambdas in other programming languages
- A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument.
- If a function’s last argument is a closure, the function can be called using trailing closure syntax. Omit the last argument from the method call and close the parentheses. Then, define the closure immediately after the parentheses are closed.
- Shorthand argument names: argument names can be omitted in favor of $0, $1
- A closure escapes a function when it’s called after the function returns. This can happen when the closure is assigned to a variable. Escaping closures must be marked with the @escaping tag in a function signature.
- Closures can capture values from their surrounding scope. When a closure captures a value, it keeps track of it and can manipulate the value even if the original function returns.

### Day 8: 4 March 2022, Friday
### **Landmarks App - MapAnnotation**

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked further on the Landmarks app - without following any tutorials, which was a nice change to really test my current SwiftUI knowledge. I worked on adding a new page where the user can have a fullscreen map which details where each Landmark is located through map pins. These map pins are clickable and take the user to the relevant LandmarkDetail page, which presents a detailed description of the Landmark. For this, I used the MapAnnotation SwiftUI view in order to place small pin Images in specific locations, which are then included in a NavigationLink taking the user to the LandmarkDetail page. Closures came in super handy and I'm glad I took the time to study them properly today. The trailing closure syntax was especially useful.  
After implementing these changes, I am sometimes getting a runtime error saying "Modifying state during view update, this will cause undefined behaviour". I read a bit on this and I am fairly understanding what the issue might be, but I plan on fixing this in the next few days after some more research.


**Key Takeaways**:  
- SF Symbols app provides a set of over 3,200 consistent, highly configurable symbols you can use in your app.
- MapMarker came in handy to quickly add markers to a map. However it proved difficult to make them clickable in order to allow navigation.
- MapAnnotation is a bit trickier to set up but it allowed me to use any icon for the map pin and then make that icon clickable to perform an action.
- I need to debug the current runtime error on the app: "Modifying state during view update, this will cause undefined behaviour"
- I want to take some time to study bindings in SwiftUI

### Day 9: 5 March 2022, Saturday
### **Landmarks App - User Input**

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the 3rd part of Apple's SwiftUI Essentials Tutorial - [Handling User Input](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/handling-user-input) and I managed to get through most of the project. It involved creating a way for the users to select their favorite landmarks and provide a toggle to only make their favorite landmarks visible. I now have a few extra concepts I need to learn about to continue my SwiftUI journey and be able to fully understand the tutorials: What does the *final* keyword mean before a class? What are property wrappers? When should we use @State, @Published, @EnvironmentObject and @StateObject? I will look into these concepts tomorrow and should be able to swiftly complete this section of the tutorial afterwards.

**Key Takeaways**:  
- State is a value, or a set of values, that can change over time, and that affects a view’s behavior, content, or layout. You use a property with the @State attribute to add state to a view.
- To combine static and dynamic views in a list, or to combine two or more different groups of dynamic views, use the ForEach type instead of passing your collection of data to List.
- A binding acts as a reference to a mutable state. When a user taps the toggle from off to on, and off again, the control uses the binding to update the view’s state accordingly.
- An observable object is a custom object for your data that can be bound to a view from storage in SwiftUI’s environment. SwiftUI watches for any changes to observable objects that could affect a view, and displays the correct version of the view after a change.
- I need to read more about property wrappers such as @State, @Published, @EnvironmentObject and @StateObject

### Day 10: 6 March 2022, Sunday
### **Landmarks App - User Input pt.2**

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the 3rd part of Apple's SwiftUI Essentials Tutorial - [Handling User Input](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/handling-user-input). I am taking my time with these tutorials as there's often some Swift concepts I have never used before, and I want to take as much away as possible for these resources. I am struggling a little bit with Data management inside SwiftUI, specifically with all of the different property wrappers available. It's currently a bit unclear which ones to use in specific cases right, but I'll get there eventually. Today I am definitely feeling more confident with it than yestertday, as I spent quite a lot of time reading about property wrappers for storage management and examples of when/how to use them. I am expecting to feel even more confident with them in the next few days.

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Whenever an ObservableObject with a property marked @Published is changed, all views using that object will be reloaded to reflect those changes.
-  A preview fails if any subview requires a model object in the environment, but the view you are previewing doesn’t have the environmentObject(_:) modifier.
- A simple rule is this: if you see “state” in the name of a property wrapper, it means that views definitely owns the data.
- I want to make a new property owned by the current view. You should use @State for value types, and @StateObject for reference types.
I want to refer to a value created elsewhere. You should use @Binding for value types, and either @ObservedObject or @EnvironmentObject for reference types.
- [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-use-environmentobject-to-share-data-between-views)
- Although class inheritance is very useful – and in fact large parts of Apple’s platforms require you to use it – sometimes you want to disallow other developers from building their own class based on yours.
Swift gives us a final keyword just for this purpose: when you declare a class as being final, no other class can inherit from it. This means they can’t override your methods in order to change your behavior – they need to use your class the way it was written.

### **Codewars Kata**

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to keep it simple and spent my coding hour solving Kata in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). Really nice to feel some real progress in the solutions I have been coming up with, specifically when they are super short. I reckon that longer solutions might be easier to read sometimes, however, it's good to still be able to come up with concise code. For this, some of Swift's higher-order functions such as .reduce(), .filter() have been incredibly useful. Looking forward to work with more complex Kata.

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Sometimes more concise code can be harder to read by other developers.
- Swift's higher-order functions such as .filter() and .reduce() have been really good ways to refactor Codewars' Kata solutions
- *where* is a powerful keyword within Swift to filter out values.

### **Landmarks App - User Input pt.3**

**Today's Progress**: Data management in SwiftUI is getting clearer now. [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) has been such an amazing resource and I have been using it quite a lot to get to understand the scenarios where we would use @EnvironmentObject, @Published, @StateObject, etc etc. I finally finsihed the 3rd part of Apple's SwiftUI Essentials Tutorial - [Handling User Input](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/handling-user-input). Looking back over the whole project, the way data flows from view to view is starting to make a bit more sense, specifically when different views share the same model data. I am really curious to start learning more about the MVVVM design. 

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Static variables are those variables whose values are shared among all the instance or object of a class. When we define any variable as static, it gets attached to a class rather than an object.
- The title string that you provide for the button’s label doesn’t appear in the UI when you use the iconOnly label style, but VoiceOver uses it to improve accessibility.

### Day 13: 9 March 2022, Wednesday
### **Starting Cookcademy App**

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to put Landmarks on the side for a bit (next tutorial step in that app will be to [learn to draw and animate with SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/drawing-paths-and-shapes)), and continue my progress in Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) by starting the foundation for the Cookcademy app. This is a digital recipe book where users can view, create, edit, favorite, and save recipes.  
Today was all about creating the model for the application, specifically around setting up the Recipe structure. Learned a few new things which are detailed in the Key Takeaways below.

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Use MVVM as a way of getting some of our program state and logic out of our view structs. We are, in effect, separating logic from layout.
- Both the static and class keywords allow us to attach variables to a class rather than to instances of a class. 
Where static and class differ is how they support inheritance: When you make a static property it becomes owned by the class and cannot be changed by subclasses, whereas when you use class it may be overridden if needed.
- With Data, we can ask iOS to ensure the file is written with encryption so that it can only be read once the user has unlocked their device. This is in addition to requesting atomic writes – iOS does almost all the work for us.
- The String(format:) method is used to create a formatted String from a Double. The %g String Format Specifier specifier suppresses any trailing zeros. If you had "1.10000", it would turn your number to "1.1". This functionality allows you to guarantee that the numbers are printed in a readable way.

### **Cookcademy App - Adding a list and sections**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on the Cookcademy app - so far it's been very similar to the Landmarks project in the sense that it presents the user with a List with clickable items that redirect the user to a detailView. Hoping that it gets a bit more complex in the next few steps, but it's good to get some extra practice with Lists and the MVVM software architectural pattern - specifically the implementation of property wrappers like @Published, @StateObject and @EnvironmentObject. I was also introduced to the concept of Sections, to organize a list. 

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Creating a list requires either passing in Identifiable structures or specifying an id with a keypath.
- Swift keypaths are a means to store a reference to a property, without actually storing the value of the property itself. Think of it as a path to the property.
- The UUID structure “creates a universally unique value that can be used to identify types, interfaces, and other items”. 
- When a structure conforms to the Identifiable protocol, it means that it must have a property called id that is a unique identifier. By using an instance of the UUID structure (built into Swift Foundation) we guarantee that id is unique. 
- If you remove the NavigationView, you will no longer be able to see the navigation title in the preview.

### **SwiftUI Grids**

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied and practiced Grids in SwiftUI. The implementation seems to be very simple, and it's really seamless to adapt the grids to different device sizes. I created a simple scrollable calendar which uses Capsules for each day of the week. Each day is then laid out (7 days horizontally) into the standard calendar layout we know. I started to import this knowledge into the Cookcademy app, to define a grid with NavigationLinks that take the user to different categories of recipes (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert).

**Key Takeaways**:  
- In order to create our grid-based view, we’ll need to define an array of GridItem instances first. These GridItem instances serve to describe the layout properties of the grid. We can use various types of GridItem instances to get the spacing and alignment of the columns or rows of the grid exactly how we wish. We can even use them to describe a grid that adjusts dynamically based on the size and orientation of the device.
- Similar to the concept of lazy properties, the Lazy in LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid refers to the fact that the elements of the grid aren’t created until they are needed to display in the view.
- Loading thousands of images would cause the app to slow down. By using lazy loading, we create much smoother, more performant user experiences.
- With GridItem, the flexible option creates a column that takes up the available width it has. You must define a minimum width, and you can optionally specify a maximum width.
- Another useful feature of grids is the ability to pin views while scrolling. The section header view sticks to the top of the screen while you are scrolling through that particular section. This can help create a smooth, intuitive user experience.
- You are not supposed to do any kind of looping/condition making block of codes while creating Array's or Dictionary.

### **Codewars Kata**

**Today's Progress**: Today I had to keep it short so I completed a few Codewars' Kata for an hour. I'm starting to feel more confident with a bit more complex coding challenges. I managed to complete a level 6 Kata and it definitely feels good. Looking forward to being able to complete level 1 challenges but, in the meanwhile, I'm really enjoying the process of getting there. Will continue working on the Cookcademy app in the next few days.

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Completed my first 6 kyu Codewars' Kata!
- Got some more practice with the *filter* higher-order function. Definitely proving to be super useful for these challenges.

### **Cookcademy Category Grid + Codewars**

**Today's Progress**: Today I managed to complete another section in Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) by building a category grid for the Cookcademy app. This meant creating a grid of 4 categories for the recipes (breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert), and redirecting the user to the chosen list of recipes, while still keeping the MVVM model by making sure the views don't directly interact with the models. I'm finding that trying to implement the requirements myself rather than directly following the tutorials has been really beneficial. I then use the tutorials to get a few hints or to compare with my solution. I also managed to complete 7 Codewars Kata. I'm really enjoying the challenges.

**Key Takeaways**:  
- For the iOS project tutorials, I'm going to try to implement the app requirements mostly by myself rather than just following the tutorial steps.
- I am now getting comfortable with Level 8 and 7 Kata in Codewars, so I'm going to try to challenge myself a bit more with Level 6 challenges.
- The map() method allows us to transform arrays (and indeed any kind of collection) using a transformation closure we specify. The return value will be an array of the same size, containing your transformed elements.
- The Image is modified to be .resizeable, forcing the image to fill all available space. Then, the image’s aspect ratio is set to .fit which forces the content to fit within the ZStack‘s frame. Here, the image will continue to shrink until the width of the photo matches the width of the view.

### **HackerRank + Codewars**

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused solely on coding challenges. I started using [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) as it was recommended for technical interview prepping. The challenges I've completed today were quite simple, but I'm pushing myself to also think out loud and explain my process as if someone else was seeing me code. From what I've read, being able to explain my thought process is super important for technical interviews and it definitely makes it a little bit harder for me at the moment, so I want to make sure I practice as much as possible.

**Key Takeaways**:  
- I'm going to start using [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) more frequently to prep for technical interviews.
- I'm going to focus on also explaining my thought process while I'm solving coding challenges.
- I'm thinking of also completing HackerRank's 30 Days of Code by solving at least one of their suggested challenges each day.

### **More HackerRank**

**Today's Progress**: Today was quite a busy day travelling but I still put in some practice with HackerRank challenges and Codecademy practice sessions for the [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer). I've recently applied for 2 roles that might lead to a technical interview so I'm starting to feel like I should shift my focus onto these kinds of challenges, at least for me to feel a bit more prepared. I'm going back to SwiftUI in a few days.
I also realised how useful the if let or guard let statements are when dealing with optionals. A few weeks ago I was struggling with a few exercises with Dictionaries because I was dealing with keys that hadn't been yet initialised. In these cases, we can use the guard let / if let statements to check if the key-value pair is already initialized -> if it is, then we proceed with our code, otherwise we can initialise them. Really useful when trying to figure out the number of times that a specific string or int shows up in an array, for example.


**Key Takeaways**:  
- Internal is the default level of access control in Swift when creating variables
- Use guard let or if let when trying to access dictionary keys that may not have been initialized already

### **More HackerRank pt.2**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on HackerRank's coding challenges. I've started doing their 30 Days of Code which I'm also expecting to complete, but those challenges are still fairly easy at the moment. Today I've also changed my approach to these problems - although I can normally come up with quick solutions using Swift's built-in functions, I'm pushing myself to also provide solutions that don't use functions like map, filter, reduce, etc, just in case I'm asked to do that in a technical interview. So, for each coding challenge, I try to provide 1 lenghtier solution with no major Swift functions and another shorter one that uses Swift's "shortcuts". So, rather than focusing on the number of challenges completed, I'm trying to explore different solutions as much as I can, even if I can come up with one solution very quickly.


**Key Takeaways**:  
- When working with coding challenges, it seems to be good practice to also find solutions that don't rely on specific Swift functions (like map, filter, reduce etc).
- I'm getting more practice with explaining my solutions out loud and also my thought process while I'm completing coding challenges.

### **Toolbars and Sheets in SwiftUI**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued my learning in Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) by practicing with Sheets and Toolbars in SwiftUI. I took a quiz and created a small project to implement what I've learnt but tomorrow I'll be working on adding these to the Cookcademy app. Additionally, I've also completed 2 HackerRank challenges. They are starting to get a bit more complex but I'm really happy I've been able to handle the challenges by breaking them down into a few different steps.


**Key Takeaways**:  
- SwiftUI’s toolbar modifier allows for placement of views along the top or bottom space of a view. For a toolbar to work properly, it must be embedded in a NavigationView.
- According to the Apple docs, a toolbar wraps views just like a VStack or NavigationView
- the toolbar is by default a transparent container.
- A ToolbarItem can be given a specific placement onto the toolbar. The placement is determined by the optional placement parameter for ToolbarItem which takes in a value of type ToolbarItemPlacement. If there is no placement given, it will default to the top right corner.
- SwiftUI sheets are used to present a new view over an existing one. Think of this as a stack of papers. You can have multiple sheets on top of one another, and the middle one can be accessed by removing the ones above it.

### Day 22: 18 March 2022, Friday
### **Adding recipes to Cookcademy + Sheets/Toolbars**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on the Cookcademy app by adding a Modal View that provides the foundation for users to add recipes to the app. Currently it only populates a newRecipe with test strings, but in the next few days it will allow users to fully save whole recipes with their own text input. I also got some practice with the @Binding property wrapper in order to understand which cases it should be used in.  
While learning what a modal view was, I also explored Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/), and it seems like such a great resource for making applications, as it provides tips to create great user experiences.  
Additionally, I also completed 4 [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) challenges.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- According to the [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/modality/), a modal view is a temporary view that’s separate from the user’s previous current context and requires an explicit action to exit.
- Presenting content modally can: help people focus on a self-contained task or set of closely related options; ensure that people receive critical information and, if necessary, act on it.
- @Binding lets us declare that one value actually comes from elsewhere, and should be shared in both places. This is not the same as @ObservedObject or @EnvironmentObject, both of which are designed for reference types to be shared across potentially many views.
- The binding allows ModifyRecipeView to access and modify the original property as if it owned recipe (*Recipe()*).

**Today's Progress**: Today I came back from work quite late so I ended doing just a quick review on closures through Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) and a few HackerRank challenges. I managed to finish 2 challenges but I also started a third one which I still need some time with.

### Day 24: 20 March 2022, Sunday
### **Forms, TextEditors and Pickers in SwiftUI**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) and learnt about some new SwiftUI concepts, such as Form, TextField, TextEditor and Picker. With this, I created a small app which consists of a simple contact form that utilises these new concepts. The apps I've been working on so far only consisted of buttons, text, navigation, haven't included any data editing, so I was looking forward to concepts I've learnt today. I'm liking SwiftUI more and more each day. Very intuitive so far and straight to the point.  
I've also completed a small quiz about today's lessons and the daily challenge from HackerRank's 30 Days of Code.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- The Form element wraps controls used for data entry. SwiftUI includes many of those controls, including toggles, text fields, pickers, and more.
- A TextField is a view that lets us enter and edit short bits of text
- While TextField is great for short bits of text, we’ll want to use something different for long-form text: the TextEditor view. Text editors let us display and edit as many lines of text as we need—perfect for composing messages, descriptions, and anything else that won’t fit on one line.
- Just as we’ve learned to do with lists, we can organize our forms using sections.
- By default, pickers use a NavigationLink to present a list of options on a separate page.
- Notice that each option has a tag attached. That’s how SwiftUI knows what value the picker represents.
- SwiftUI lets us choose from a few different picker styles that might better suit our needs. We can apply a picker style using the .pickerStyle() view modifier.

### Day 25: 21 March 2022, Monday
### **HackerRank's Basic Problem Solving Certificate**

**Today's Progress**: Today I was 100% focused on HackerRank's coding challenges. I felt prepared for the [Basic Problem Solving Certificate](https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-verification/problem_solving_basic) so I decided to give it a try. It was a 1h30 test with 2 different challenges. I was quite impressed that, even though I got to the solutions and my test cases were passing, the submission wasn't being counted as "valid" or "correct" because the computation for my algorithm took longer than HackerRank's limit for Swift (2 seconds). Although this was frustrating, as the problem solving part of it was "correct", it served as a "wake up call" for me to start studying the time complexity of my solutions and how to make them more efficient. I'll be able to take the test again in 30 days.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- HackerRank Certificates apparently require the solutions for their challenges to be able to be computed quicker than their specified maximum time for the used language.
- I need to start thinking about the time complexity of my solutions to coding challenges. How can I start studying it?

### **Adding new recipe editing for Cookcademy**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on the Cookcademy app by adding a features that lets users customize the main information section of a new recipe (name, author, description and category). This was done using the new concepts I learnt a few days ago from Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) around Picker, Form, TextField, TextEditor and Sections. I'm still continuing my journey through the tutorials by trying to come up with my own implementation before reading the full step by step guide, which has been going surprisingly well. This is allowing me to really test what I've learnt and make sure that I get real practice.  
I've also completed HackerRank's daily coding challenge through their [30 Days Of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code). Currently on day 8.

### Day 27: 23 March 2022, Wednesday
### **Continuing recipe editing in Cookcademy**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on the recipe editing for Cookcademy, specifically the ingredients section. I was able to implement the addition of new ingredients to the list, by creating a new view that presents the user with the current list of ingredients and a button to add a new ingredient. That button then redirects the user to another view which will detail the name of the ingredient, the quantity, and the units (if applicable).
I got introduced to the Stepper view and how we can use it to easily change numeric values in our application.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Use keyboardType(_:) to specify the keyboard type to use for text entry. A number of different keyboard types are available to meet specialized input needs, such as entering email addresses or phone numbers.
- Use a stepper control when you want the user to have granular control while incrementing or decrementing a value. For example, you can use a stepper to: change a value up or down by 1; operate strictly over a prescribed range; step by specific amounts over a stepper’s range of possible values.
- Instances of NumberFormatter format the textual representation of cells that contain NSNumber objects and convert textual representations of numeric values into NSNumber objects. The representation encompasses integers, floats, and doubles; floats and doubles can be formatted to a specified decimal position. NumberFormatter objects can also impose ranges on the numeric values cells can accept.

### **Protocols and Generics in Cookcademy**

**Today's Progress**: Today I got some more real-world practice with generics and generic where clauses, by creating a view for Cookcademy that can edit either Ingredients or Directions in each recipe of the app. I also had to implement protocols to make sure the model had the necessary structure properties to be "compatible" with the views, such as Ingredient and Recipe both having a String representation (description such as "3 tablespoons of olive oil" / "Bake for 35 minutes"). This reminds me of polymorphism with C++ and it definitely is a great way of avoiding redundant code.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Types that conform to the CustomStringConvertible protocol can provide their own representation to be used when converting an instance to a string. The String(describing:) initializer is the preferred way to convert an instance of any type to a string. If the passed instance conforms to CustomStringConvertible, the String(describing:) initializer and the print(_:) function use the instance’s custom description property.
- Type constraints, as described in Type Constraints, enable you to define requirements on the type parameters associated with a generic function, subscript, or type.
- A generic where clause enables you to require that an associated type must conform to a certain protocol, or that certain type parameters and associated types must be the same. A generic where clause starts with the where keyword, followed by constraints for associated types or equality relationships between types and associated types.

### **HackerRank challenges**

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on solving 3 different HackerRank challenges. I'm currently doing their [1 Month Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/one-month-preparation-kit) for technical interviews and I'm on week 2. It's getting to the point where each challenge is taking me almost 30 minutes to complete and they're getting more and more complex. However, it feels like progress because I have still been able to complete them and fully understand the solution. There is only one challenge so far from HackerRank which I still haven't found a solution for. Will come back to it in a few days.

### **Static properties in Cookcademy + HackerRank**

**Today's Progress**: Today I made a small improvement on Cookcademy in order for app the able to display the name of the generic component that is being displayed (is the user seeing a recipe or a direction?). This was done by adding a static property to the RecipeComponent protocol and then displaying it on the screen. I'm starting to feel like I have been able to solve all of these "bugs" by myself without looking at the tutorial and I think it's a sign that I'm improving! Additionally, I completed 2 HackerRank challenges.

### **Abstract classes + Codewars**

**Today's Progress**: Today I had a brief introduction to abstract classes. Although they don't seem to be an option with Swift, I guess it doesn't hurt to learn about it. According to HackerRank, abstract classes are "the separation between what a class does and how it's accomplished. One real world example of this concept is a snack machine, where you give the machine money, make a selection, and the machine dispenses the snack. The only thing that matters is what the machine does (i.e.: dispenses the selected snack); you can easily buy a snack from any number of snack machines without knowing how the machine's internals are designed (i.e.: the implementation details)."   
Additionally, I went back to Codewars and completed 3 challenges. 


**Key Takeaways**: 
- An abstract class can have abstract methods as well as defined methods, but it cannot be instantiated (meaning you cannot create a new instance of it). To use an abstract class, you must create and instantiate a subclass that extends the abstract class. Any abstract methods declared in an abstract class must be implemented by its subclasses (unless the subclass is also abstract).
- With Swift Dictionaries, we can use dictionary[key, default: x] to assign a default value whenever a key hasn't been assigned. Very useful when using dictionaries to keep count of something (example: counting how many times each letter appears in a string)

### **Codewars Tech Interview Prep**

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused solely on coding challenges. For each challenge, I was going through my thought process out loud, explaining my idea before implementing it, and then explaining the implementation itself while I was coding it. Whenever I reached a suitable solution, I would stop and consider: "Is there any other solution that would be simpler/quicker/shorter?". And then, I would refactor my code or account for different "roadblocks", such as "how would I do this without using any major built-in Swift functions (like filter, map, reduce, etc etc)?   
Most of the challenges I completed were from Codewars. It's great to look back to [day 16](#day16) (when I had completed my first level 6 challenge) and realising how comfortable I am now with most level 6 Codewars Kata.

### Day 33: 29 March 2022, Tuesday
### **Intro to Linked Lists**

**Today's Progress**: I've been looking forward to today: I finally started learning about Linked Lists. We thouched on it during my Software Development for Audio module at university but didn't actually get any practice with this concept. From what I've been reading, it seems like it's a popular subject in some tech interviews, so I thought it definitely was worth learning about it. I started with the [HackerRank - Day 15: Linked List]((https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-linked-list?isFullScreen=true) and then went over to [Codecademy - Intro to Algorithms and Linear Data Structures in Swift - Linked Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/intro-to-algorithms-and-linear-data-structures-in-swift) to get a more practical intro to Linked Lists. This involved creating our own Linked Lists in Swift and adding features like removing nodes, inserting nodes, getting nodes, etc. I'll be honest, I'm still processing all of the information, but I'm understanding it a lot better than the first time I heard about it.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- A Linked List is comprised of a series of nodes. The head node is the node at the beginning of the list. Each node contains data and a link (or pointer) to the next node in the list. The list is terminated when a node’s link is null. This last node is called the tail node.
- Since the nodes use links to denote the next node in the sequence, the nodes are not required to be sequentially located in memory. These links also allow for quick insertion and removal of nodes.
- If you accidentally remove the single link to a node, that node’s data and any following nodes could be lost to your application, leaving you with orphaned nodes. To properly maintain the list when removing a node from the middle of a linked list, you need to be sure to adjust the link on the previous node so that it points to the following node.
- The runtime efficiency of our append function should be constant, or Θ(1). Since we are adding nodes to the tail, which we always have a reference to, the runtime is the same for all linked lists, no matter how many nodes are in them.
- A function to find and return the data of a node at a specific index should have a runtime efficiency of Θ(n) since the worst-case scenario would be to search through the entire length of the chain of nodes, n, for a node.

### Day 34: 30 March 2022, Wednesday
### **Continuing Linked Lists**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued my journey with Linked Lists, by reviewing Codecademy's [Intro to Algorithms and Linear Data Structures in Swift - Linked Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/intro-to-algorithms-and-linear-data-structures-in-swift) and completing some HackerRank challenges on Linked Lists. I'm curious to learn how this data structure can actually benefit software developers and how it can be used in a practical scenario.  
Additionally, I reviewed Error Handling with Swift (specifically with the try-catch statement) through HackerRank's 30 Days of Code challenge (Currently on [Day 16](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-exceptions-string-to-integer?h_r=profile))

**Key Takeaways**: 
- If your code attempts to perform an action that cannot be completed, the flow of control is halted and an exception is thrown. This means that an Exception object is created as a response to this unusual condition. The control flow is then transferred (or handed off) to an exception handler. By anticipating and writing handlers for exceptional conditions in your program's logic, you can resolve the issue that raised the exception and your program can continue executing. A program "crash" is generally the result of an unhandled exception.
- Linked Lists form the basis for many other data structures, which I'll be studying later on.

### Day 35: 31 March 2022, Thursday
### **Asymptotic Notation**

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about another important concept for developing algorithms: asymptotic notation. I've heard about Big-O Notation for a while now and it's good to finally understand what it actually is, as well as Big-Omega and Big-Theta. From what I understood, Big-O is normally the most important one for tech interviews and for programming in general, as we should always be prepared for the worst case scenario. This will definitely help me go back to HackerRank's problem solving certificate test where, even though my solutions were "correct", they were taking too long to run.  
I also realised the Swift documentation has the time complexity for some of its own methods (like sort, filter, etc), which might come in handy in the future. 

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Asymptotic Notation is used to describe the running time of an algorithm - how much time an algorithm takes with a given input, n. There are three different notations: big O, big Theta (Θ), and big Omega (Ω). big-Θ is used when the running time is the same for all cases, big-O for the worst case running time, and big-Ω for the best case running time.
- You may see the term execution count used in evaluating algorithms. Execution count is more precise than Big O notation.
- Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting. It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow. Big O doesn’t focus on the details, only the trends.
- When describing runtime, people typically discuss the worst case because you should always prepare for the worst case scenario! Often times, in technical interviews, they will only ask you for the Big O of a program.
- The different common runtimes from fastest to slowest are: Θ(1), Θ(log N), Θ(N), Θ(N log N), Θ(N2), Θ(2N), Θ(N!).
- When finding the runtime of a program with multiple steps, you can divide the program into different sections and add the runtimes of the various sections. You can then take the slowest runtime and use that runtime to describe the entire program.

### Day 36: 1 April 2022, Friday
### **Queues and Stacks with Swift**

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about two more data structures: Queues and Stacks. Thinking about it, I remember using a FIFO (First In First Out) structure - Queue - during my final year project at university, specifically to load audio samples into a buffer before processing and outputing them. And then Stacks are very similar but operate by LIFO (Last In First Out). I managed to get some practice with each data structure by creating both in Swift using an array or a linked list as a base structure. Now I'm starting to see how Linked Lists can be used in real world scenarios by helping to create other more complex data structures.  Also, I learnt about the === operator (identity operator) and used it for the first time.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Queue follows FIFO (First In First Out) protocol
- The queue data structure has three main methods: - **enqueue** (adds a node to the back of the queue); **dequeue** (removes node at the front of the queue); **peek** (returns value of node at the front of the queue, without removing it).
- A Stack is a data structure that follows a last in, first out (LIFO) protocol.
- The stack data structure has three main methods: push(), pop() and peek(). The push() method adds a node to the top of the stack. The pop() method removes a node from the top of the stack. The peek() method returns the value of the top node without removing it from the stack.
- Similar to stacks, attempting to enqueue data onto an already full queue will result in a queue overflow. If you attempt to dequeue data from an empty queue, it will result in a queue underflow.
- === is the identity operator, which checks whether two instances of a class point to the same memory. This is different from equality, because two objects that were created independently using the same values will be considered equal using == but not === because they are different objects.
The === operator is available only when using classes because structs are designed so they are always uniquely referenced.

### Day 37: 2 April 2022, Saturday
### **Recursion + Intro to Hash Tables**

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed Codecademy's sections on Recursion and Nodes, and started the Hash Table tutorial through the [Introduction to Algorithms and Linear Data Structures in Swift](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/intro-to-algorithms-and-linear-data-structures-in-swift). The concept of recursion and calling a function within itself is something I've been doing for a while but I hadn't realised there was an actual term for that, so it's good to finally be "formalising" my knowledge so far.  
Hash Tables is something I'll still need more time with, particularly when it comes to creating hashing functions and handling hashing conflicts. This data structure feels very similar to Dictionaries in Swift, so how I'm curious to learn more about how the two structures relate to each other.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Recursion is a strategy for solving problems by defining the problem in terms of itself. A recursive function consists of two basic parts: the base case and the recursive step.
- A recursive function should have a base case with a condition that stops the function from recursing indefinitely.
- A recursive function should have a recursive step which calls the recursive function with some input that brings it closer to its base case.
- Your programming language often manages the call stack, which exists outside of any specific function. This call stack tracks the ordering of the different function invocations, so the last function to enter the call stack is the first function to exit the call stack.
- An execution context of a recursive function is the set of arguments to the recursive function call. Programming languages use execution contexts to manage recursive functions.
- Hash maps are a common data structure used to store key-value pairs for efficient retrieval. A value stored in a hash map is retrieved using the key under which it was stored.
- Hash map data structures use a hash function, which turns a key into an index within an underlying array. The hash function can be used to access an index when inserting a value or retrieving a value from a hash map.

### Day 39: 4 April 2022, Monday
### **Cookcademy - Editing existing recipes**

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a few extra features for Cookcademy. We are now able to edit existing recipes rather than only being able to edit new ones. I still need to debug a few things specifically when it comes to saving the edits. For some reason, they are not updating straight away. I need to make the change, go to a different view, come back to previous view and only then I can see the changes. Strange. The next step will be to implement a way to reorder and delete the list of ingredients and directions. 

**Key Takeaways**: 
- The letters enclosed between angle brackets (< and >) are type parameters and, like many things in programming, there is a convention behind them (remember, following conventions help us write clean, readable code!). The letters below are commonly-used generic type parameters: E - Element; K - Key; V - Value; N - Number; T - Type (e.g.: data type); S,U,V, etc. These are second, third, and fourth types for when T is already in use.

### Day 40: 6 April 2022, Wednesday
### **Cookcademy - Editing existing recipes pt.2 + Trees**

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday was my birthday so I decided to take 1 day off from this challenge, but I spent some extra time today working to make up for it. Firstly, through the HackerRank [30 Days Of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) challenge I was introduced to Trees, specifically Binary Search Trees. Although I've roughly understood what they were, I'm still not aware of how we can use these types of data structures within real-world scenarios. I'll be spending some time again with Data Structures in the next few days.  
Additionally, I've added added an Edit process to the ingredients and directions sections of the Cookcademy app, which enables users to delete specific ingredients/directions and move them around in the list (most useful for the directions where the order of steps is very important). I also managed to do some debugging for the problem I mentioned on [day 39](#39), and it seems like the some bug is happening even when I'm using the same exact source code provided by Cookcademy. Will continue digging deeper in the next few days to see if I can find a solution.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Fundamentally, a binary tree is composed of nodes connected by edges (with further restrictions discussed below). Some binary tree, *t* , is either empty or consists of a single root element with two distinct binary tree child elements known as the left subtree and the right subtree of *t*.
- The convention for binary tree diagrams is that the root is at the top, and the subtrees branch down from it.
- A node's left and right subtrees are referred to as children, and that node can be referred to as the parent of those subtrees.
- A non-root node with no children is called a leaf.
- The depth (or level) of some node  is its distance (i.e., number of edges) from the tree's root node.

### Day 41: 7 April 2022, Thursday
### **Tab Views and Labels in SwiftUI**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) by finishing the section about Tab Views and Labels. I've used both already but one thing I didn't know about was how to use TabView to create different "pages" that can be swiped sideaways in order to change the current view (the same way we would change the current photo in Photos on iOS). I created a very simple project experimenting with these concepts and I'm going to be implementing them in Cookcademy tomorrow. It's going to be useful for users to swap between the recipes list / recipe detail and their favorite recipes.  
Additionally, I completed another HackerRank challenge which involved removing duplicated data from a LinkedList. Getting fairly comfortable with with Linked Lists now.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Garbage collection is a form of automated memory management that frees up memory locations that are no longer in use.
- If you're writing in a language that does not have garbage collection, you should make sure you are freeing up the memory that a reference refers to before deleting the reference itself.
- Removing an element from a linked list of nodes is easier than it sounds! In a language with automatic garbage collection (like Java), you simply have to change the next reference from one node so that it points to another node.
- Tab views allow more complex applications a degree of flexibility that they would not have otherwise. For example, in order to access any other page, such as a user profile, we’d need to go all the way back to the main menu. With the help of a tab view, users can quickly and easily navigate to a profile page by clicking on the icon at the bottom. The video here shows an example of that.
- Stylizing the tab view with a PageTabViewStyle will remove the tab bar view and display each view as individual pages. These pages can be accessed by scrolling through the views with a swipe gesture.

### Day 42: 8 April 2022, Friday
### **Persistence in iOS**

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about persistence in iOS, and how we can make sure than certains properties in our apps are still saved after the app has been restarted. This can be implemented with User Defaults, the file system and Core Data. Today I focused on User Defaults to save some user preferences for the Cookcademy app. This involved creating a SettingsView where users can change the colors of the background in the ingredients/directions list, the color of the text and if the list of directions includes optional steps.  
I also finished implementing the favorites tab, which displays the user's favorite recipes (favorites don't persist yet), as well as reviewing Throwing Functions and JSON Decoding/Encoding. 

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Persistence is the ability to save information so that it persists between restarts. Without persistence, you’d start from scratch every time you open an app—your settings, documents, photos, and more would be lost.
- In iOS, there are a few different ways to persist data. Of these, the most important are User Defaults, the file system, and Core Data.
- User Defaults is the simplest way to store information on iOS. With User Defaults, we can access the defaults system, which is designed for storing user preferences and other simple data. We call this the defaults system because it often determines the app’s default state when it’s first opened or how the app behaves by default.
- SwiftUI provides the @AppStorage property wrapper that gives direct access to UserDefaults. Simply wrapping a property with @AppStorage will automatically persist it to UserDefaults when it changes, and access UserDefaults to get the most up-to-date value.
- To wrap a property with the @AppStorage property wrapper, the type must already be supported by the @AppStorage property wrapper, or conform to RawRepresentable.
- @AppStorage writes your data to UserDefaults, which is not secure storage. As a result, you should not save any personal data using @AppStorage, because it’s relatively easy to extract.

### Day 43: 9 April 2022, Saturday
### **NotesApp - Using the iOS File Manager**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued focusing on persistence with SwiftUI, specifically through the iOS File Manager. With this, I decided to create a small project off of Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) (rather than copying their code, I decided to build my own app by following their wireframes.) It consisted of a simple notes app, with the ability to either edit existing notes (title and content) or adding new ones. After this, I implemented persistence by encoding the notes array property to a JSON file, and saving the file into the app's file manager. For this app, it seemed to be a pretty straightfoward implementation: convert the needed property into Data -> encode Data with JSONEncoder -> save with Data.write(to: fileDestinationURL). When loading: create Data(fromContent: fileDestinationURL) -> notesArray = JSONDecoder().decode([Note].self, from: Data). We then perform the save process whenever the notesArray changes, and perform the loading process whenever the mainView is loaded. 

**Key Takeaways**: 
- For persistence with iOS: User Defaults is best for small bits of data; The file system is best for documents and large files; Core Data is best for large webs of interrelated data.
- Like other classes, we can create as many instances of the FileManager as we’d like. However, since there’s only one file system for us to work with, it’s unlikely that we’ll need more than one FileManager instance. That’s why the FileManager is a singleton—an object that’s instantiated only once throughout our app’s lifecycle. To access the singleton instance from our code, we can use the default property of the FileManager class.
- Before we can save our notes to a file, we’ll first need to determine where that file will be located. This takes two steps: Use the FileManager to find the URL for the directory we want; Use the resulting URL to build the path to our file.
- On iOS, each app receives its own “sandbox” directory with subdirectories that serve different purposes. This improves security by preventing apps from modifying files other than their own, while also making it easier for us to include features such as iCloud backups.
- [Apple's Guidelines on where to put your app's files](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW28)

### Day 44: 10 April 2022, Sunday
### **Cookcademy - Using the file system**

**Today's Progress**: I finally reached the last session for Cookcademy. Today was all about finishing persistence in the app and making sure that everything was being saved and loaded correctly. This includes any new recipes, any existing recipes that are being edited and being selected as favorites. It was a lot easier than what I was expecting, so that was good. SwiftUI still continues to amaze me with how simple it can make my life sometimes. Really excited to learn more and more about it.  
Cookcademy still has a few bugs or missing features before I mark it as properly completed: whenever I'm trying to edit ingredients in an **existing** recipe, the quantity doesn't update automatically on the screen, even if I click on the **+** button. Also, there is still no way to delete recipes. After that, I'll start another project and continue learning about Algorithms and Data Structures, and will only come back to Cookcademy to fix any additional bugs that I might eventually find.

### Day 45: 11 April 2022, Monday
### **Deleting recipes in Cookcademy + Regex**

**Today's Progress**: Today I got an introduction to Regular Expressions in Swift through HackerRank's [30 Days Of Code challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code). I am understanding the general concept roughly, but I still need some more practice with it. Definitely seems to be useful (I can see it being relevant in a search bar feature, for example).   
Additionaly, I managed to add a feature to Cookcademy in order for the user to be able to delete individual recipes. It was a bit trickier than I was expecting because, when the user is presented with the RecipesList, it's just displaying FilteredRecipes by their category. What that means is, whenever we need to delete a specific recipe, we need to find which recipe it's referring to within the FilteredRecipes, match it with the same exact one in the Recipes Array and only then delete it from the source. Currently that logic is still coded into the RecipeDetailView so I will try and think of a way to implement it within the ViewModel instead - I want to make sure that Logic and Views are separated as much as possible. Another improvement that I already have in mind is that, whenever the user is deleting recipes from the Favorites tab, it should only unmark that recipe as a favorite, rather than actually deleting it.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Regular expressions allow us to run complex search and replace operations across thousands of text files in just a handful of seconds
- Apple provides support for regular expressions on all of its platforms – iOS, macOS, tvOS, and even watchOS – all using the same class, NSRegularExpression.
- Swift Strings are automatically bridged to NSStringwhich means String has some nice features that allow us to easily perform pattern matching (via a regular expression) on a String. The best example is the range(of:options:) method on the NSString class.

### Day 46: 12 April 2022, Tuesday
### **Cookcademy - Deleting Favorites + Bitwise Operators**

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally finished HackerRank's [30 Days Of Code challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code). I definitely learnt a lot with this extra practice, and I'm looking forward to continuing with HackerRank challenges. This last problem was about Bitwise operators, specifically the Bitwise AND. I read that these are specifically useful with low-level programming like graphics programming, drivers, etc.  
I also managed to implenent another feature in Cookcademy: now, whenever users are removing a recipe from the favorites tab, it only makes the recipe non-favorite, whereas if you remove it from the normal recipe list, it actually deletes the recipe.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Bitwise operators perform operations on integer data at the individual bit-level. These operations include testing, setting, or shifting the actual bits.
- The bitwise AND & operator returns 1 if and only if both the operands are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.
- The bitwise OR | operator returns 1 if at least one of the operands is 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.
- The bitwise XOR ^ operator returns 1 if and only if one of the operands is 1. However, if both the operands are 0, or if both are 1, then the result is 0.
- The bitwise NOT ~ operator inverts the bit( 0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0).
- The left shift operator shifts all bits towards the left by a specified number of bits. It is denoted by <<.
- The right shift operator shifts all bits towards the right by a certain number of specified bits. It is denoted by >>.

### Day 47: 13 April 2022, Wednesday
### **HackerRank Challenges**

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on some more HackerRank challenges to prepare myself for a potential interview in the next few days. I've been trying to think out loud through the exercises and it seems to be getting a bit less distracting for me. I'm also finding that, with more complex challenges, thinking about the Big O notation of my algorithms has been more and more important, to make sure that they don't exceed HackerRank's maximum time limit for the runtime. Whenenever I get to a solution, I try to analyse the current Big O and think for a few extra minutes if there are any changes I could make to my current approach, until I refactor it into a more refined solution.  

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Big O notation is getting more and more important with more complex HackerRank challenges.
- I need to start thinking about the problem itself first instead of the Swift implementation.

### Day 48: 14 April 2022, Thursday
### **Landmarks App - Saving favorite landmarks**

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally went back to the Landmarks app in order to add a new feature: persisting the selection of favorite landmarks between restarts. Now, whenever a user (un)marks a landmark as a favorite, the JSON data is updated for subsequent app loads. Although I had studied iOS Persistence a few days ago with the Cookcademy app, this implementation was a bit different as the JSON file in Landmarks is stored in the Bundle (Resources) instead of the Documents Directory. The problem with this is that, apparently, files in the app Bundle are not editable.   
So, with this in mind, whenever the app is opened for the first time, a new file is created in the Documents Directory and the contents of the JSON file in the Bundle are copied there. If the app has been opened before, then the landmarks are loaded from the JSON file in the Documents Directory. This way, whenever the favorite option of a landmark is toggled, the JSON file (in Documents Directory) is saved with the new changes.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- In iOS, you can't write into a file in your app's bundle -- the entire bundle is read-only. Use a path into the Documents folder instead.
- FileManager.default.copyItem(atPath:toPath:) copies the item at the specified path to a new location synchronously. 
- FileManager.default.isReadableFile(atPath:) returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the invoking object appears able to read a specified file.

### Day 49: 15 April 2022, Friday
### **Landmarks App - Categories Tab**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working through Apple's [iOS App Dev Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training) and created a new Featured tab for the app. It essentially contains a vertical ScrollView that contains various horizontal ScrollViews containing landmarks of specific categories (Lakes, Mountains and Rivers). It presents an image of each landmark which, when clicked, takes the user to the LandmarkDetailView of that landmark. No major new concept learnt here, but I definitely need to spend more time exploring the way that the different views are laid out here, specifically when it comes to padding, fonts, color, modifiers, etc.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- I need to spend some more time exploring how the different types of padding, fonts, colors and modifiers from the tutorial actually affect the final look of the Category tab, to then be able to implement them all by myself.

### Day 50: 16 April 2022, Saturday
### **Landmarks App - Categories Tab pt.2**

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent some more time with the Landmarks app going through yesterday's [tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/composing-complex-interfaces) and trying to fully understand the modifiers that were being used for the visual aspect of the app. I found it a bit confusing yesterday, specifically when it came down to making the photos the correct sizes and making sure they were dynamic depending on the size of the device. I managed to note down some key takeaways below.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Use listRowInsets(_:) to change the default padding of the content of list items.
- Dictionary(grouping:by:) creates a new dictionary whose keys are the groupings returned by the given closure and whose values are arrays of the elements that returned each key.
- Use the clipped(antialiased:) modifier to hide any content that extends beyond the layout bounds of the shape.
- The Image.TemplateRenderingMode enumeration has two cases: Image.TemplateRenderingMode.original and Image.TemplateRenderingMode.template. The original mode renders pixels as they appear in the original source image. Template mode renders all nontransparent pixels as the foreground color, which you can use for purposes like creating image masks.
- scaledToFill() scales the view to fill its parent.
- scaledToFit() scales the view to fit its parent.

### Day 51: 17 April 2022, Sunday
### **Trees in Swift**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued my learning with Data Structures, by studying Trees. Codecademy recently released a new Skill Path -> [Pass the Technical Interview with Swift](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-swift) and I was super happy to see that they added a lot more content than there was before for Swift, specifically around Non-Linear Data Structures. I'm really enjoying the way that Codecademy explains each of them and how it "forces" us to practice it during the tutorials. They also added a few articles on tips about whiteboard interviews and common interview problems with Swift, which I'm definitely looking forward to reading through.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- Trees grow downwards in computer science, and a root node is at the very top
- Each node will only ever have at most one parent; otherwise, they wouldn’t be trees.
- When a node has no children, we refer to it as a leaf node.
- Each time we move from a parent to a child, we’re moving down a level. Depending on the orientation we refer to this as the depth (counting levels down from the root node) or height (counting levels up from a leaf node).
- A binary tree is a type of tree where each parent can have no more than two children, known as the left child and right child.
- In a binary search tree: Left child values must be lesser than their parent; Right child values must be greater than their parent.
- Function overloading (or method overloading, depending on your programming language), is the practice of creating multiple instances of a function with different parameters and/or return types.

### Day 52: 18 April 2022, Monday
### **Trees in Swift pt.2**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued learning about Trees in Swift. This is really testing my ability to think abstractly. I can understand the concept of trees in computer science, but when it comes to thinking about things like breadth-first traversal / depth-first traversal on a more low level, it gets a bit trickier to focus at the moment, specifically when thinking about recursion, queues and stacks to achieve tree traversal. However, these concepts are still quite fresh in my brain, so I definitely need some more practice and time to feel comfortable with them.  I'm implementing my tree structure in Swift by creating functions to add, remove, find, print and traverse (breadth-first and depth-first) TreeNodes.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- We can define equality by implementing the Equatable protocol and define what equal means to our classes.
- We can change the way Swift prints a class by implementing the CustomStringConvertible protocol and defining what data to return as the description variable.
- Depth-First Traversal: climbing from the root and following each branch down to its leaves
- Breadth-First Traversal: climbing all the branches on the same level (depth) before moving to the next level.
- There are several different ways to implement a depth-first algorithm: pre-order traversal, post-order and in-order. Will come back to this later on.

### Day 53: 19 April 2022, Tuesday
### **LeetCode Challenges**

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally started using LeetCode after so many recommendations to try it. I'm really enjoying the fact that I get to compare my solutions with others when it comes to time and space complexity. It gets me to really think about ways to improve my solution, and it was just what I needed to get back to HackerRank's Problem Solving Certificate (I managed to create suitable solutions for the certificate's test, but they ended up being too inneficient time-wise. I also like the fact that LeetCode forces me to use the Data Structures I've recently learning about to complete the solutions (a few challenges from today were based around Linked Lists, while also touching on Stacks and Queues).

**Key Takeaways**: 
- LeetCode lets us compare our solutions with others when it comes to time and space complexity.
- I am finally starting to actively utilising the Data Structures I've been learning about, mainly Linked Lists.
- I will retry HackerRank's Problem Solving Certificate test again in a few days, now that I am aware of how time complexity affects my algorithms.

### Day 57: 30 April 2022, Saturday
### **Concurrency and Swift**

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally got back on track - my parents went back to Portugal yesterday so I'm back to coding everyday. I started studying concurrency and multi-threading with Swift, specifically in order to be able to use APIs through network requests. I was familiar with the concept of multi-threading from working with audio software (I always had to make sure the audio processing was done on a separate thread to the UI processing) but I'm still not 100% comfortable with it. I learnt about the different ways a device can process tasks (sequentially, concurrently and in parallel), and about Grand Central Dispatch, which handles thread creation and CPU processing for Swift. I also had an introduction to async functions and await statements, which I'm looking forward to experimenting with tomorrow.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- In programming, concurrency refers to an application’s ability to process more than one task at a time. If an application processes tasks concurrently, the tasks must be independent of one another. This means that the completion of tasks is not dependent upon other tasks being completed.
- In the sequential approach, activities are executed in a specific order to provide a specific outcome. In the concurrent approach, activities are executed in any order and will still achieve the desired result.
- Parallelism is the execution of multiple tasks at the same time : parallelism needs hardware with multiprocessing units whereas concurrency does not; parallelism assigns each task for a core to execute whereas concurrency executes all tasks by switching tasks at the same time.
- Every application begins with one thread known as the main thread. In Swift, the main thread is also known as the main queue. Think of the main queue as the entire application. The main queue will then spawn other threads to complete tasks for the application. This is known as multi-threading.
- The main thread is responsible for all application logic, including UI updates and interactions. Since the main thread is a serial queue and responsible for the entire application, it is imperative that you don’t put tasks on it that take a long time.
- Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is Swift’s older framework for creating threads, handling tasks, and managing concurrency. Swift 5.5 introduced a new way to manage concurrency, but many older applications will use GCD

### Day 58: 1st May 2022, Sunday
### **Intro to APIs with Swift**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued on the topic of concurrency and finally got to use an API for the first time. For this, I'm creating a very simple app through Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) that requests random users from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) as a JSON file and displays some of their information. I'm finding that I'm fairly comfortable with the concepts behind APIs, but still processing all of the information I learnt yesterday about multi-threading in iOS (we need to make sure that the API requests don't block the UI processing and is done on a different thread). Fortunately, Swift's [URLSession.shared.data(from: URL)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/3767353-data) function already processes the network requests on a background thread for us.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- The MainActor is a globally unique actor who performs tasks on the main thread so you don’t perform UI updates on a background thread.
- The async keyword declares a function as asynchronous - a coroutine. Coroutines are functions that may return normally with a value or may suspend themselves internally and return a continuation.
- The await keyword works like the try keyword. It will execute the asynchronous function and wait for the result.
- The URLSession can call the function data(from:) to retrieve data from an API's URL.
- By default, URLSession operations occur on a background thread and do not need to be specified otherwise.

### Day 59: 2nd May 2022, Monday
### **JSON review + Coding Keys**

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to do a bit of a review on JSON, as well as learning about Coding Keys in Swift. Coding Keys seem to be useful when we rather have a different name for our properties within our data model than following the naming convention from the JSON itself. At the moment, the [RandomUsers App](https://github.com/joaomauricio5/RandomUsers/commits/main) only displays the actual JSON text to the user, but as I will be implementing a proper User structure next, this concept will come in handy.   
I also learnt that Swift provides us with a way to manually decode JSON into our structures, whenever we don't want to follow the exact structure that the JSON file has. This can be done with the [init(from decoder: Decoder)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/decodable/2894081-init) initializer.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Coding Keys can be declared in the form of an enumeration which conforms to the CodingKey protocol and has a raw value of type String. Coding Keys give us the ability to have modified versions of our properties so that we’re not always relying on the naming conventions provided by the API response.
- Decodable offers a customer initializer for manually decoding JSON. 
- Instead of relying on the automatic decoding that Decodable brings with it, we’re able to manually bring together different keys in a JSON response and convert them into the date type we want in our data model.

### Day 60: 3rd May 2022, Tuesday
### **Converting JSON to User - RandomUsers App**

**Today's Progress**: Today I made some progress on the RandomUsers app, by finally handling the JSON response from the API with Coding Keys, in order to get the user's names and uuid's. Coding Keys and the custom decoding came in super handy as both the names and uuid were both nested in dictionaries in the JSON response, and the uuid, in the User structure, needed to be called "id" instead in order to conform to the Identifiable protocol to be used in a List.  
I also had a brief introduction to Unit Testing with XCTest, Xcode's framework to write tests for Xcode projects. I've been really curious about this in the last few weeks and I'm really looking forward to focusing on it tomorrow.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- A function that tests something in our codebase is called a unit test. This unit test is responsible for testing for edge cases, such as calling a function by passing in an empty array as an argument, and overall making sure that the code works as expected.
- Tests assert that certain conditions are satisfied during code execution, and record test failures (with optional messages) if those conditions aren’t satisfied. Tests can also measure the performance of blocks of code to check for performance regressions, and can interact with an application's UI to validate user interaction flows.

### Day 61: 4th May 2022, Wednesday
### **Unit testing with XCTest**

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on Unit Testing with XCTest through Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) and created a simple app that sums two numbers and is able to load a JSON file, only to test the functions that were implemented. Although I only focused on testing the logic, I'm also really curious to learn UI testing later on. I can definitely see how incredibly important testing is on a huge codebase which is constantly being updated and refactored, to make sure that although the code changes, the behaviour doesn't.  
Tomorrow I will import this new knowledge to the RandomUsers app and start creating some tests for the API handling.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Our goal should be to write unit tests that fail when the behavior of our code changes so that we can catch this and make the necessary adjustments.
- XCTest Starter Code: **setUpWithError** - This is a setup method. It lets us initialize variables as needed before each test method is called; **tearDownWithError** - This is a teardown method. It lets us clean up variables, set them to nil, etc after each test method is called; **testExample()** - This is a basic test method. Making sure our test methods are prefixed with test enables it for testing in Xcode; **testPerformanceExample()** - This method shows how a performance test measuring time can be written.
- XCTAssert and XCTAssertTrue assert that an expression is true.
- XCTFail generates a failure immediately and unconditionally.
- XCTAssertNotNil asserts that an expression is not nil.
- XCTAssertEqual asserts that two expressions have the same value.
- XCTAssertGreaterThan asserts that the value of the first expression is greater than the value of the second expression.

### Day 62: 5th May 2022, Thursday
### **RandomUsers App - Unit Testing pt.2 + AsyncImage**

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the RandomUsersApp: I started by creating an extra unit test to evaluate the JSON decoding that was done through the app. One thing I realised from this is how important it is to "think ahead" about the tests, so that it really evaluates the behaviour and not the code itself, specifically with code that might be refactored/upgraded later on.  
Additionally, I implemented profile pictures for each user by utilising SwiftUI's [AsyncImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/asyncimage) to load the images from the given url asynchronously. Super useful that it abstracts a lot of work that would need to be done, such as networking, multi-threads handling, etc, just to download an image from an URL.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- With AsyncImage, as soon as the image gets downloaded, it is modified by the code inside the closure containing the content image and rendered into a view on the main thread.
- The scale parameter will make sure our image is loaded and scaled to the correct resolution. It is most useful when loading high-resolution images.
- With AsyncImage, we're able to add a placeholder image until the one that was requested is finally downloaded fromt the URL.
- We can even set specific images to be shown based on the loading states of the asynchronous process giving us the power and flexibility to create a robust user experience.
- Use ProgressView() to show that a task is making progress towards completion. A progress view can show both determinate (percentage complete) and indeterminate (progressing or not) types of progress.

### Day 63: 6th May 2022, Friday
### **Intro to Relational Databases with PostgreSQL**

**Today's Progress**: Today I took a break from Swift and finally began learning about SQL - more specifically with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). Experience with relational databases seems to be a popular requirement for developer roles, so I'm excited to learn more about it. I started by learning the basics of SQL's syntax: creating tables, inserting/updating/removing data, setting constraints, data types, queries, etc. After that, I installed [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Postbird](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/postbird) (GUI client for PostgreSQL), and created a small database with information about some movies (such as name, runtime, release year, earnings) that was added both through SQL statements as well as the GUI. No major roadblocks for now, but I'm curious to see how much more complex SQL can get.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- A relational database is a type of database that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.
- Tables can have hundreds, thousands, sometimes even millions of rows of data. These rows are often called records.
Tables can also have many columns of data. Columns are labeled with a descriptive name (say, age for example) and have a specific data type.
- A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database. Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database.
- SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases.
- A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.
- SELECT is a clause that indicates that the statement is a query. You will use SELECT every time you query data from a database.

### Day 64: 7th May 2022, Saturday
### **SQL Queries and Agreggate Functions**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued my progress through Codecademy's [Design Databases with PostgreSQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/design-databases-with-postgresql) Skill Path, and focused on SQL queries and agreggate functions. I can imagine SQL might be very relevant for Data Science, just from how easy it is to get conclusions about the whole database by filtering down the data we actually need and finding relevant patterns. For example, one of the exercises I did today revolved around a database of restaurants in New York, which included data about average price, neighborhood, health rating, etc. From here, with a large enough dataset, we could make some assumptions about how these bits of information relate to each other: Do specific neighborhoods tend to have more expensive restaurants? Do cheaper restaurants generally have a lower health rating? Do certain neighborhoods have more restaurants with higher health ratings?  

**Key Takeaways**: 
- SELECT is the clause we use every time we want to query information from a database.
- AS renames a column or table.
- DISTINCT returns unique values.
- WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
- LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators.
- AND and OR combines multiple conditions.
- ORDER BY sorts the result.
- LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return.
- CASE creates different outputs.
- COUNT(): count the number of rows
- SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
- MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
- AVG(): the average of the values in a column
- ROUND(): rounds the values in the column to a number of decimal places that we can specify as the 2nd argument.
- GROUP BY is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
- HAVING limits the results of a query based on an aggregate property.

### Day 65: 8th May 2022, Sunday
### **SQL Queries and Agreggate Functions**

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Codecademy's [Design Databases with PostgreSQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/design-databases-with-postgresql) Skill Path up to the point where I already finished the basic [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) course. Today was about working with multiple tables and how they will relate to each other. This was especially useful to get some [guidelines about designing my own databases](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/are-there-guidelines-to-splitting-a-table-as-provided-in-the-example/356116?_gl=1*kk22fj*_ga*MTE5NjU3NTA0NC4xNjQ2OTE5ODQ1*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY1MjAyMTc0OC4xNDcuMS4xNjUyMDIxNzUyLjU2) in a way that they avoid data redundancy - having lots of columns which are present in various tables with the same information.  
I finished the day off by getting started on a PostgreSQL exercise off-platform from Codecademy, where I need to work with an [external database](https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics) and find answers to the project's questions. It was my first time working with a huge database - 29 tables, where some of them have hundreds of thousands of rows. A bit overwhelming at first but I'm getting there.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- JOIN (Inner Join) will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.
- LEFT JOIN (Outer Join) will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.
- Primary key is a column that serves a unique identifier for the rows in the table.
- Foreign key is a column that contains the primary key to another table.
- CROSS JOIN lets us combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.
- UNION stacks one dataset on top of another.
- WITH allows us to define one or more temporary tables that can be used in the final query.

### Day 66: 9th May 2022, Monday
### **SQL Challenges**

**Today's Progress**: Today I managed to complete quite a few SQL challenges by going through this [database](https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics) and finding specific information, such as: find the team with the highest average weight of its batters on a given year; find the team that had the smallest “cost per win” in 2010; find the pitcher who, in a given year, cost the most money per game in which they were the starting pitcher, if they started at least 10 games, etc. I also completed a few SQL challenges from LeetCode.
I can see how many companies ask for practice and knowledge about SQL, as it seems to be invaluable when navigating huge databases. I'm really curious to see how I can pair this up with Swift and iOS apps in the next few days.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- In SQL, a comparison against a null value does not evaluate to true or false , it evaluates to unknown. We should use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL.
- The IN operator is used in a WHERE clause that allows checking whether a value is present in a list of other values.
- [PostgreSQL IN, Not IN with examples](https://www.guru99.com/postgresql-in-not.html#5)
- The PostgreSQL LEFT() function returns the first n characters in a string.

### Day 67: 10th May 2022, Tuesday
### **Back to Linked Lists + SQL practice**

**Today's Progress**: Today I went to back to studying Linked Lists and practiced a bit more SQL through LeetCode. I had a look at how to swap nodes in linked lists, as well as the two-pointer technique - this one is going to be super useful, as I had a few linked list challenges that I wasn't sure how to solve without using arrays (which could easily use a lot of unnecessary space), but using the two-pointer technique is such a great idea when we need to keep track of multiple node positions: find the middle of the linked list; returning the node that is n places behind the tail, etc. I also started getting some practice with reversing linked lists, as it seems to be quite popular in technical interviews.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- Many linked list problems can be solved with the two-pointer technique. If it seems like a linked list problem requires keeping track of multiple positions or creating other data representations (such as using an array), consider whether two pointers iterating in parallel or at different speeds could help solve the problem efficiently.
- We can reverse a linked list through recursion or using a loop.

<a name="day68"></a>
### Day 68: 11th May 2022, Wednesday
### **Database Schemas, Keys and Relationships**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued Codecademy's [Design Databases with PostgreSQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/design-databases-with-postgresql) Skill Path by studying schemas, keys and relationships within databases. In the last few days I mostly studied how to accurately ask for information from a database that was already created, whereas now we're looking at how to actually design and create databases to ensure that data redudancy is minimised and that our information is constrained, while at the same time being more easily accurate. I studied/practiced with different types of keys (foreign, primary, composite) in order to implement different table relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Like an architectural blueprint, a database schema is documentation that helps its audience such as a database designer, administrator and other users interact with a database. It gives an overview of the purpose of the database along with the data that makes up the database, how the data is organized into tables, how the tables are internally structured and how they relate to one another.
- A database key is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identifies a row in a table.
- Designating a **primary key** on a particular column in a table ensures that this column data is always unique and not null. For example, there may be multiple recipes of the same name, each with its own id but no two recipes should share the same id.
- Sometimes, none of the columns in a table can uniquely identify a record. When this happens, we can designate multiple columns in a table to serve as the primary key, also known as a **composite primary key**.
- A **foreign key** is a key that references a primary key column in another table.
- In a one-to-one relationship, a row of table A is associated with exactly one row of table B and vice-versa. For example, a person may only have one passport assigned to them. Conversely, a passport may only be issued to one person.
- To enforce a strictly one-to-one relationship in PostgreSQL, we need the UNIQUE keyword appended to the declaration of the foreign key.
- We need to represent a one-to-many relationship with two tables - a parent and a child table. Analogous to a parent-child relationship where a parent can have multiple children, a parent table will house a primary key and the child table will house both primary and foreign keys. The foreign key binds the child table to the parent table.
- A many-to-many relationship can be broken into two one-to-many relationships. To implement a many-to-many relationship in a relational database, we would create a third cross-reference table also known as a join table. It will have these two constraints: foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the two member tables; a composite primary key made up of the two foreign keys.

### Day 69: 12th May 2022, Thursday
### **Database Schemas, Keys and Relationships pt.2**

**Today's Progress**: Today was all around practicing yesterday's concept around designing databases schemas by implementing relationships between tables and their keys. I managed to create a database for a restaurant, which included separate tables for: restaurant (in case they opened more than one), address, category (for dishes), dish, review and join table - category_dishes, as some dishes will have different prices depending on which category they're bought from (main dish or lunch deal). It was a good method of practicing and thinking about different relationships -> one-to-one: each restaurant_id can only have a single address; one-to-many: each restaurant can have multiple ratings/reviews; many-to-many: each category can have multiple dishes and each dish can be represented in multiple categories (ex: vegan dishes + fried rice dishes).

**Key Takeaways**: 
- [DbDiagram.io](DbDiagram.io) - a free, simple tool to draw ER diagrams by just writing code, designed for developers and data analysts.
- We can query a special view, key_column_usage, generated from the information_schema database to identify all columns in the current database that are restricted by some constraint such as primary key or foreign key.

### Day 70: 13th May 2022, Friday
### **LeetCode SQL Challenges**

**Today's Progress**: Today was all about solving [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/) challenges around SQL. A lot of the challenges have been revolving around sub-queries and joining different tables, and I'm happy that I'm getting along well with SQL after just a week of starting to learn about databases. I'm well aware that there is still a lot to learn though: I'm getting more and more curious to see how I will be able to implement this knowledge within iOS Development and Swift. Will come back to Swift/SwiftUI tomorrow by improving the RandomUsers App.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- The LIMIT x determines the number of rows (x) returned by the query. Whereas the OFFSET n clause skips n rows before beginning to return the rows.
- The IF(x, y) function returns x if a condition is TRUE, or y if a condition is FALSE.
- IFNULL(x, y) functions returns x IF the expression is NULL, otherwise it returns y.

### Day 71: 14th May 2022, Saturday
### **RandomUsers App + Constraints in PostgreSQL**

**Today's Progress**: Today I started by adding a new feature to the RandomUsersApp: it now has a button which allows the user to load an extra 10 Users from the API, instead of having a fixed number of displayed Users (code changes available in the commits below) Next step will be to implement infinite scrolling (very much like Instagram / Facebook) where more Users would automatically be loaded while I scroll down the app.  
Also, I learnt about constraints within PostgreSQL and how they are useful to safeguard a database and maintain data integrity (more information below), finishing off by creating a small database to practice these concepts.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- Constraints are rules defined as part of the data model to control what values are allowed in specific columns and tables.
- Columns of a PostgreSQL database table must have a data type, which constrains the type of information that can be entered into that column.
- Althought data types aren’t constraints, they can help reject incorrect data from a database.
- There are different types of constraints: NOT NULL constraints — Reject incoming rows from your table when critical information is missing from a row; CHECK constraints — Allow us to reject a row if it fails the criteria we’ve defined; UNIQUE constraints — Help with defining unique values in a table, they also create an index which can improve query and join performance; PRIMARY KEY constraints — A column or combination of columns that uniquely identify a row and are both NOT NULL and UNIQUE. PRIMARY KEYs are unique to a table, and will often be used in joins between tables; FOREIGN KEY constraints — Allow us to maintain referential integrity between two tables by validating the entry in one also appears in the other.
- Backfilling is a term occasionally used in DB engineering to refer to the process of adding or updating past values.

### Day 72: 15th May 2022, Sunday
### **Linked Lists + SQL challenges**

**Today's Progress**: As I'm having an interview tomorrow and I'm focusing on preparing for it, I decided to just complete a few LeetCode challenges, without going through any new concepts. I finally got some pratice with reversing linked lists and it's significantly less complex than what I was thinking, at least with the iteration method. Reallistically, we only need to change the nodes so that they point to their previous node in the list. I'm curious to also figure out how we can implement this through recursion instead of iteration. 

**Key Takeaways**: 
- DATEDIFF(date1, date2) returns the number of days between two date values.
- The DATE_PART(field, source) function extracts a subfield from a date or time value, where "field" evaluates to TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL or TIME, and it can have values such as: century, decade, month, day, minute, second, etc.

### Day 74: 17th May 2022, Tuesday
### **RandomUsers App - Infinite Scrolling + Intro to SQL Indexes**

**Today's Progress**: Today I went back to the [RandomUsers App](https://github.com/joaomauricio5/RandomUsers) to implement infinite scrolling, where the list just keeps getting bigger and bigger the more the user scrolls through it. This was done by attaching an onAppear(perform:) modifier to each user in the list, but it only triggers loadMoreUsers() if the user that is currently appearing on the screen (through scrolling) is the last user in the array of Users. This way, we know that the app reached the end of the list and we need to load more Users from the API. I also added a ProgressView (progress circle noting that the app is loading) while the app is loading, for when the app is opening on a slower (or inexistent) internet connection: If array of users is still empty, show ProgressView; else, show list of Users.   
I also had a brief introduction to Indexes in PostgreSQL, and how they can be used to make our filtering faster when querying a database. Will dive deeper into it tomorrow.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- Use a ProgressView() to show that a task is making progress towards completion. A progress view can show both determinate (percentage complete) and indeterminate (progressing or not) types of progress.
- onAppear(perform:) adds an action to perform when the view it is attached to appears.

<a name="day75"></a>
### Day 75: 18th May 2022, Wednesday
### **PostgreSQL - Indexes**

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied and practiced a concept that is used to make sure that databases stay fast: Indexes. Indexing allows us to organize the database structure in such a way that it makes finding specific records much faster. By default it divides the possible matching records in half, then half, then half, and so on until the specific match we are searching for is found, very much like a binary tree. In this way, indexes speed up searching and filtering. However, there is a disadvantage associated with it, as indexes seem to slow down inserts, updates and deletions, as well as taking up significant space. I tested this by implementing indexes in different columns for tables with >100 000 entries, and using PostgreSQL's EXPLAIN ANALYZE to check the runtime of specific queries with and without indexes.


**Key Takeaways**: 
- Indexes speed up searching and filtering, however, they slow down insert, update, and delete statements. Also, the index data structures can sometimes take up as much space as the database itself.
- To get insight into how PostgreSQL breaks down your statements into runnable parts, we can investigate the query plan by adding EXPLAIN ANALYZE before your query. Rather than returning the results of the query, it will return information about the query.
- The index is built in the specific order listed at creation, so (last_name, first_name) is different from (first_name, last_name). The order will impact the efficiency of our searches.
- The higher the percentage of a table we are returning the less useful an index becomes. If we’re only searching for 1 record in 1,000,000, an index could be incredibly useful. However, if we are searching for 900,000 out of that same 1,000,000 the advantages of an index become useless.
- Even if we have a single non-indexed condition, if it’s in an OR, the system will still have to check every record in your table, making our index useless.

<a name="day76"></a>
### Day 76: 19th May 2022, Thursday
### **PostgreSQL - Indexes pt.2**

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued my learning around PostgreSQL's indexes and how they can be used to make querying a database a more efficient (or inefficient) process. I'm starting to feel like indexes are not going to be a "set-and-forget" scenario, as they will depend on a lot of different variables: how many entries does the database have? how regularly are we going to query the index? Are we going to update the indexed column more than we are going to query it? In addition to this, the usage and querying of a database might change from time to time, so it seems reasonable to drop and create new indexes frequenty as well.  
I had a look at clustered indexes, non-clustered indexes, partial indexes, ordered indexes, as well as creating indexes with functions instead of only column references. I also completed 2 projects about these concepts from Codecademy's [Design Databases with PostgreSQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/design-databases-with-postgresql) Skill Path.



**Key Takeaways**: 
- pg_Indexes is a built-in view in PostgreSQL which lets us identify the existing indexes in a database.
- To see the size of a database table we can run the SELECT pg_size_pretty (pg_total_relation_size('<table_name>')).
- Normally an index doesn’t have any real-world impact until we are in the thousands (and normally larger than this) of rows.
- A partial index allows for indexing on a subset of a table, allowing searches to be conducted on just this group of records in the table.
- Each table can only have a single clustered index.
- A clustered index contains all the information in our table and physically reorganizes the way it is stored in memory. A non-clustered index creates a key on the columns we indicate and a pointer back to the main table for any columns not part of the index.
- In PostgreSQL, the CLUSTER keyword can be used to create a new clustered index on a table, or recluster a table already setup with an index.
- PostgreSQL can use indexes to return results in order without a separate step to sort. This is done by specifying the order (ASC or DESC) we want the index to be in when we create the index.
- A column Index is not limited to just a column reference, it can also be a function or scalar expression computed from one or more columns.

Socialcademy will be a social media app, with the abillity to authenticate different users, upload posts, etc through SwiftUI and Firebase (Google's Backend-as-a-Service app development platform). This is my first time using Firebase and most of the day was spent learning about what it is, setting it up, downloading the SDK to my Xcode project, etc. I'm going to be using Firestore for the app, which is a NoSQL database, so I also got introduced to non-relational databases and how they layout their data. Additionally, it was my first time using the Swift Package Manager, in order to add dependencies to the project directly through Xcode.

**Key Takeaways**: 
- A backend is a software application accessible on the internet, usually via a server, that the app connects to in order to store and receive data. The client-server model allows our backend to receive requests for information from a “client” (usually a user, but not always!). The server can then respond to the request in a variety of ways: authenticating the user’s credentials to log them in; storing data for users in a database; process a payment that the user triggered; storing files for users to retrieve and load later on.
- A non-relational database, commonly referred to as a NoSQL database, specializes in storing unstructured data in a non-tabular form. A non-relational database does not have a fixed “schema”, as its data can look different from each other.
- The following are 4 different types of non-relational databases:
* 		Key-value: A non-relational database that houses data in the form of a collection with key-value pairs. Each key is a unique identifier and each value represents some data.
* 		Column-oriented: A non-relational database that stores its data in columns as opposed to rows. Each table organizes its data by field rather than by record.
* 		Graph-based: A non-relational database that is designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself. This means that data is not stored with a predefined model and is instead stored showing how each individual entity connects with others.
* 		Document-oriented: A non-relational database that stores its data in documents through a JSON structure.
- Non-relational databases store data as collections (as opposed to tables)
- Whenever you use someone else’s code in your project, that is known as a dependency, because your code now depends on theirs to work.
- Swift Package Manager is the newest tool for managing dependencies, and the one that we’ll be using in this article. It is fully integrated with Xcode and has an easy-to-use interface for adding and removing dependencies from your application.
